# JavaScript Null Value Handling

This example demonstrates a common yet important practice in JavaScript: handling null values to prevent unexpected behavior.

The `foo` function adds two numbers.  However, it explicitly checks for null values in its input arguments.  If either `a` or `b` is null, the function returns null.  This prevents potential errors like `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading '+')`.

This approach ensures robustness and predictability in the function's output, particularly when dealing with data from external sources which may sometimes be null.
